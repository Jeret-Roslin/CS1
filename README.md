Welcome to my CS1 code project
My name is Jeret and I'll show you my code
All of these are written in python fyi
Some require you to download visual studio and all will run on visual studio but not idle
In order to use these files download the code you want to see and open it in visual studio
then at the top right of your screen you'll see a play button click that and play some of the games and other codes have!
If you notice an error feel free to fix it or reach out to me
Please do not mess with the codes.
Have fun!!!
